1. Your games will eventually be placed at [Dr Ecco web site](http://cims.nyu.edu/drecco/index.php?task=homepage "Dr Ecco web site")
2. We are hoping that you picked a game for the final project. Your team name and game name should be in the list below. If not, please email it to us csci_ga_2965_001_fa15@cs.nyu.edu
3. Sample PHP based template from Gravitational Voronoi is maintained here
4. Contain your game HTML elements to a "div" tag as shown:
<code>
&lt;div id="gameArea"&gt;
...
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>
5. Do not use applets and embedded objects (as you might have seen these eventually become unusable because of the numerous dependencies on OS, web browser, plug-in security and hot fixes and such)
4. We support PHP for any server side inclusions
5. For the browser side, use HTML5 and Javascript
6. Note that these games are for person-to-computer play. So the game parameters and the game tactics could change (as to what constitutes a move, placing a move, game timeouts and so on) from the weekly games we play.
7. It is important that you maintain a score for the winner and allow an alphanumeric name for the player, since these would eventually make it into a leaderboard for your game
8. The leaderboards are maintained within Dr Ecco site and not a part of the game. The templates will show the integration point between the game and the site
9. Current line up of teams
